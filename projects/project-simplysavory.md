## Overview

Simply Savory is a web application that provides a centralized site for UH Manoa students to learn and share affordable recipes that can be prepared with minimal kitchen facilities (both on and off campus) to suit local taste sensibilities. Users will be able to browse posted recipes, search and filter by specific ingredients, and save recipes to their personal “cookbook”. Recipes will have additional information that is useful for students on a budget, such as price per serving, and ingredient sales at nearby supermarkets.

## My Contributions

I worked on creating the individual recipe cards getting it to display real data as well as linking them to display the full overview of a recipe. I also worked on a liking recipe functionality that works just like any regular social networking application. I also worked on a vendor functionality where someone could sign up as a vendor to display deals for users to look at to save money on ingredients.

## Reflections

Overall this web application took a lot of time and effort to develop. However, through learning new software engineering concepts like Agile Project Management and design patterns my team and I were able to speed up the design process and work effectively as a team to get the project done. It made the project go a lot smoother than I had imagined as working on a big coding project with other people can be challenging if work is not distributed effectively. I took away a lot of key skills that will help me in future software development projects.
